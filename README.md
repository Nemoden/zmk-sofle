## My ~~Sofle~~ corne layout

Main uses:
- Programming
- As mouseless as it can be
- A lot of vim and tmux

The reason why I call my Sofle a corne is because I got myself a Sofle and turned it into a 42-keys keyboard by removing all the hard to reach keys - whole top row as well as 2 keys on either side of the thumb cluster.
